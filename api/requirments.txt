I'm going to work on ingesting the additional objects I've created.



First request: addressable pages. I should be able to do a GET on either /0001 or /School, and get the School page.



Second request: hyperlinks. The Superclass, ExpectedAttributes, DefaultParent, CrossrefEntities attributes all contain the names of other data elements, and should hyperlink to them (enabled by the foregoing). So Campus has

Superclass:   School



School should be hyperlinked to "/School" (or "/0001")


Third request: I would like the superclass links to be available as inverses. So ACARA ID and AGE ID are both instances of Identifier, as is named in the Superclass. I would like preprocessing to add ACARA ID and AGE ID to a "Subclass" list for Identifier.


For the second request, note that I'm already presupposing those crossreference URLs in the definitions: the definition of Campus links to the definition of School.
